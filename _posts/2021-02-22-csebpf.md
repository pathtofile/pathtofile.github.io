A while back I spent some time at work learning about eBPF Maps, to understand the consequences of a malicious user tampering with them, plus ways to detect such an attack.

It's nothing new to eBPF veterans, but others might find it interesting: https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analyzing-the-security-of-ebpf-maps/


I've also got a PoC looking at how to use eBPF to monitor and log eBPF map alterations. It was less straightforward than I thought it would be, which was interesting: https://github.com/CrowdStrike/bpfmon-example
