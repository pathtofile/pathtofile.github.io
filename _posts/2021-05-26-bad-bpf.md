# tl;dr
I've been fascinated by offensive applications of eBPF for a while, and so I've 
[release a few tools](https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf) demonstrating a range of offensive, defensive, and anti-anti-RE techniques.
 
# Trace Away
At this year's BlackHat USA, Guillaume Fournier, Sylvain Afchain, and Sylvain Baubeau
[will present a talk](https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#with-friends-like-ebpf-who-needs-enemies-23619)
about using eBPF as a rootkit.
 
Offensive eBPF is something I've been interested in for a little while, so while the talk from Guillaume and the team will
cover a full rootkit design (from Command and Control to Container Escaping to Data Exfiltration to more), I thought I'd share the one aspect of eBPF that has fascinated me the most - The ability to warp reality, and paint different pictures of the 'truth' to different programs and users.
While not strictly an eBPF-only feature, eBPF makes this easier to do in more places, and therefore the opportunity for offensive and defensive
teams are greater than perhaps it's ever been.
 
 
# eBPF Primer
[This article](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf) explains what eBPF is much better than I can, but in essence it allows
an administrator to attach programmable trace points to the Linux Kernel for one of 2 broad purposes:
- Efficiently routing network packets
- Observing function calls for debugging or security monitoring
 
The second point is the one that I will focus on in this blog, although both have interesting offensive and defensive uses.
 
What makes eBPF more interesting that traditional Kernel modules is that it comes with very strong memory safety
and efficiency guarantees, thanks to a program verifier that checks code statically and dynamically to ensure eBPF programs can't crash 
a system, or otherwise break something important.
 
For this reason, it is increasingly possible to run eBPF programs in places where you
can't run Kernel Modules, such as in Managed kubernetes environments like Amazon EKS.
 
eBPF Programs are limited in what they can see and do, but this limit still allows for a level of shenanigans beyond
what you can do in userspace, and (as I'll discuss later) there's not a lot of security tooling looking into malicious eBPF usage.
 
 
 
# Malicious Tracing
A common use-case for eBPF is to attach programs to two parts of the Linux Syscalls, which are the main way user space programs
communicate with the kernel:
1. At the `entry` to the syscall, to observe the parameters sent to the kernel
2. At the `exit` to the syscall, to observe the response from the kernel.
 
For example, when a userspace program wants to read a file, it will commonly use two syscalls: `openat` and `read`:
 
![Picture highlighjting syscall flow from openat to read](/assets/syscall_flow_01.png)

 
The first call to `openat` returns an `fd` file descriptor, which is then passed into `read` to get the data from the file.
 
If we wanted to track what programs are reading what files (and what the data in the file was), we could attach a number of eBPF programs to the `entry` and `exit` of those two syscalls:
 
![Picture highlighjting syscall flow from openat to read, with eBPF Programs attached to entry and exit of each syscall](/assets/syscall_flow_02.png)

The programs attached to `openat` record what filename is assosiated with what fd number, and the programs attached to `read` record what was read from what file.

If you were to run these programs as-is, you'd probably quickly be inundated with events, as it will log every file opened by every program across the entire system. 
 
Thankfully eBPF provides a number of 'helper' functions to only run based upon executable, the user running the program, or really anything in the parameters or return value.
 
This is one of the advantages of using eBPF for tracing - The ability to intelligently select when to run your trace programs.
For malicious programs, this ability to behave differently in different circumstances can have fascinating results.
 
Additionally, eBPF programs are restricted from altering the parameters or return values it observes. However, if the parameter or return value is a pointer to userspace memory, then the program *is* allowed to read and write to wherever it points to, thanks to the two eBPF helper functions `bpf_probe_read_user` and `bpf_probe_write_user`.
 
Combined, the ability to selectively alter data in between userspace and the kernel is a powerful offensive primitive, that can have a wide range of possible uses.
 
 
# Sudo lie to me
As an example, let's say an attacker has compromised a web server, and temporarily has root access.
They know they can always get back on the machine by leaving behind a webshell, but on this machine the web server
runs as the low-privileged `apache` user, which is not in the list of users allowed to `sudo` to become root. The attacker needs a way to allow it's webshell `apache` user to become root, in a way that can't be easily detected by an administrator or security tool.
 
When a user runs `sudo`, the program will look in the `/etc/sudoers` file for details on what that user can or cannot do.
If a user isn't allowed to use `sudo`, their name won't be in the file.
 
Based upon our earlier syscall diagram, a malicious eBPF program can the call to `read /etc/sudoers` call from `sudo`, overwriting the data returned from the kernel to inject a line saying `apache` is allowed to become root:
 
![Picture highlighjting how eBPF can intercept paramaters and return codes from syscalls](/assets/syscall_flow_03.png)

 
By only overwriting the data coming back from `read`, the actual `sudoers` file on disk never changes, and by only altering the data for `sudo` administrators using `cat` or security tools such as `auditd` only ever see the unaltered data.
 
This technique would also work if `sudo` is using a custom [PAM Module](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/pluggable-authentication-modules-pam) to enforce multi-factor, as PAM configuration is stored as text inside `/etc/pam.d/`. The eBPF program can just lie to `sudo` about the PAM configuration to say no multi-factor or even password is needed.
 
 
# Hiding Processes, Hijacking execve
Lying about the contents of files isn't the only thing malicious eBPF programs can do. Using `bpf_probe_write_user` anything
that gets sent or received as a userspace buffer can be altered. Some other possibilities include:
- Hiding process from `ps` by lying about the contents of the `/proc/` pseudo-folder
- Changing the Executable filename when a program calls the `execve`, hijacking execution
- Hiding an "ignore all" AuditD rule by intercepting data being sent from the AuditD's netlink socket to a userspace controller
 
By combining the ability to alter userspace data, with the ability to precisely target the alterations at specific processes
and users, eBPF becomes a powerful tampering tool that is hard to detect and defeat without the right knowledge.
 
 
# Detection Challenges and Opportunities
If you didn't know eBPF existed or could be malicious, detecting such attacks would be challenging.
Unlike traditional hooking or KProbes, eBPF programs using tracepoints don't alter the function's address or code,
so it's much less obvious there is something 'in between' userspace and the kernel.
 
However, with knowledge of eBPF, you can use the `bpf` syscall to list out all running eBPF programs and any related usermode processes.
Of course a malicious eBPF program can intercept this syscall, so your best bet may be one of:
 - Offline memory forensics
 - Kernel Module Sensor
 
For memory forensics, I've created a basic Volatility Plugin and Kernel Module to extract ebPF programs from volatile memory dumps (see [tools](#tools) below).
 
Otherwise for a live system, the good news is eBPF cannot write to kernel memory, which makes it much harder to hide from kernel-based security monitoring.
So while eBPF can hide processes from `ps`, the actual process information still resides in the kernel, and security callbacks to
systems like [Linux Security Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules) or AuditD occur untampered.
 
If you believe you can run before anything malicious does, you can even use eBPF to detect malicious eBPF program loading by monitoring
the `bpf` syscall, or even restricting its use to trusted programs.
 
 
# Anti-Anti Debugging
The upcoming Black Hat talk will cover much broader examples of malicious eBPF usage, so the last point I'll make is that
these techniques need not be limited to offensive purposes.
 
A Common way malware attempt to prevent itself being poked at by security researchers is to implement anti-sandbox checks,
to ensure they are running on a real victim and not a sandbox or virtual machine. One way to do this is to check the manufacturer
of the network card, to see if it matches with a list of known virtual machine manufacturers. This can be done by
reading the `address` file in `/sys/class/net`, so we can intercept these reads to lie to the malware, convincing it that 
It's running on a real machine. Using eBPF you could even implement a full fake filesystem, pretending to read and write files
without the malware seeing or interacting with the real system underneath.
 
 
# Tool Drop
To demonstrate everything I've written about in this blog, I've released a number of tools to Github.
 
## Bad BPF
I've created a collection of offensive eBPF Programs named [Bad BPF](https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf).
These tools demonstrate a number of offensive eBPF techniques:
- Intercepting `sudo` read calls to enable a low-privileged user to elevate to root
- Hijacking calls the `execve` to change the program being launched
- Hiding process from `ps` by intercepting directory listings to `/proc`
- Replacing arbitrary text in files to demonstrate kernel module hiding and MAC Address faking
- Deny any calls other uses of the `ptrace` syscall by sending a `SIGKILL` to kill the process.
 
The code should be well commented to help understand how they are able to work.
 
 
## Volatility2-eBPF
I've created a plugin for Volatility 2 to [enable dumping of eBPF Programs](https://github.com/pathtofile/volatility2-ebpf) from a memory capture. This could help in determining if a malicious eBPF program is hiding itself from usermode tools such as `bpftool`.
 
## eBPFMod
I've also created a kernel module that behaves like `Volatility2-eBPF`, but can be run on a live system, that I've called [bpfMod](https://github.com/pathtofile/bpfmod).
 
It will print metadata about the active eBPF Programs, and dump the programs to disk.
It circumvents the `bpf` syscall, so it should work when a malicious program is hiding/tampering with the data, and being a kernel module
a malicious eBPF program cannot prevent it from writing the data to dmesg and disk.
 
However a malicious program could always tamper with any userspace program reading the output from `bpfmod`, so it may be
preferable to do offline analysis with `Volatility2-eBPF`.
 
 
## BPFMon-PoC
A while ago I also created a simple PoC demonstrating how to use eBPF to monitor eBPF program loading and map alterations: [BPFMon-Example](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/bpfmon-example). This accompanied prior research I did into the effects of [tampering with the eBPF Maps](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analyzing-the-security-of-ebpf-maps/) of legitimate programs. While not directly related to this blog, this might serve as a useful example of how to use eBPF to monitor itself.
 
 
# Conclusion
This blog only scratches the surface of what's possible when eBPF is used for offensive purposes.
I highly recommend checking out the [Black Hat talk](https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#with-friends-like-ebpf-who-needs-enemies-23619) when it becomes available, and reach out to the presenters
or myself with any other questions/thoughts you may have.
 
For future research, I'm very interesting in exploring how eBPF can affect things when attached to not just syscalls, but instead
further inside the kernel (but perhaps where this is still usermode buffers to alter).
