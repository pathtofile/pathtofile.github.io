# Overview
I've been wanting to do more to automate my binary reverse engineering process. As I really only do in in
my spare time for fun, automating the basic parts leaves me with more time to do the more interesting analysis stuff.

So I came up with a simple research 'question', that I would have to solve using Ghidra, and its Python-based Scripting API.

# Hypothesis
**Given a native Windows DLL, you can tell the difference between a malicious and benign file, but comparing the *size* of code that gets run when the library is loaded.**

The idea is that malware authors will either:
 - Do *more* than the 'normal' entrypoint, as they are doing tricky anti-RE checks and downloading 2nd stagers; OR
 - Do *less* than the 'normal' entrypoint, as they only need to launch their payload and bail, and not prepare to be running as a real library that does stuff.

I had no idea prior to starting this if this could be true, or even how to measure **size**. I settled on the following process:
1. Grab some legitimate and malicious DLLs
2. Look in the DLL's Optional Header and go to the DLL's `entrypoint` function
3. Measure various things from the start of the function to the end, such as:
    1. The number of instructions in the entrypoint function and all sub functions
    2. The number of functions called by the entrypoint and all sub functions
4. Compare results (**spoiler - results negative, but I learn't how to script Ghidra for future questions**)

With an idea of the steps I needed to take, I set about scripting them up.

# Ghidra and Ghidra Scripting
My usual tool for binary analysis tool is [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org), for a few reasons:
1. Being free means people don't have to pay money to share/replicate/improve any work I share using it, unlike IDA Pro
2. I haven't found decomilation using plugins to Radare2 or Binary Ninja to work super well, particulary for Windows binaires
3. Ghidra came with a bunch of tutorial docs on how to use it, which helped get used to it's buttonology and interfaces

Ghidra also comes with a powerful scripting API, allowing you run scripts to automate analysis and either display them in the UI, or even run headless without a GUI at all.

There are some annoyances with writing Ghidra scripts, mostly due to the fact they have be written in [Jython](https://www.jython.org), which is based upon Python 2.7, and the fact Ghidra runs its own intepreter. Some of these things are
- No f-strings or newer Python 3.6+ features
- Can't easily use external libraries to enhance analysis, without doing runtime path trickery.
  - Plus the libraries would have work in Jython/Python 2.7, which most won't.
- The Ghidra inbuit functions that your script will use won't be on you intepreter path, so no tab-complete/docstrings in your IDE

Fortunetly, there are a couple of ways to make development easier:
- Using [Ghidra pyi Generator](https://github.com/VDOO-Connected-Trust/ghidra-pyi-generator) fixes the tab-complete/docstrings in your IDE
  - This works in VSCode, PyCharm, and probably other IDEs as well
- [Gidra Bridge](https://github.com/justfoxing/ghidra_bridge) marshals code from Python3 to Ghidra's Jython intepreter, which allows you to write scripts in real Python 3, do any external library loads, etc.
  - The mashalling does slow scripts down though, so for simple scripts like mine stick to Jython

# Running the Script
The final Ghidra Script I write is here: https://github.com/pathtofile/ghidra_scripting/blob/master/count_entrypoint.py
The script finds the entrypoint function, and then recusivly checks this function and all sub functions and counts:
1. Each time a function is called
2. The number of 'addresses' in each function
   - This isn't "number of instructions", but it will be of a similar scale, so for our purposes it fits

It then tallies up:
1. Total number of addresses
2. Number of unique addresses
3. Total number of functions called

To launch the script, I first got a bunch of DLLs from various places, including Windows, Firefox, Metepreter, and some real malware samples. 

I then ran the following command over each of them to quickly and headlessly anaylyse them:
```bash
<path/to/ghidra/analyzeHeadless.bat> <projects_folder> testproj -postscript countentryponit.py -import "<path/to/library.dll>"
```

Where:
- `path/to/ghidra/analyzeHeadless.bat` is the path the Ghidra installation
- `projects_folder` and `testproj` is the path to where my Ghidra Projects live on disk, and the name of an already-created project
  - Unfortunetly I didn't see a way to have the project also created via the commandline, so I had to first create it using the UI
- `path/to/library.dll` is the DLL to analyse

# Results
Here's the output from the first pass of running the script across various DLLs:

## My own MSVC dll with an empty dllmain
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 6114,
  "total_addresses_unique": 3197,
  "total_functions": 140,
  "file_size_kb": 11
}
```

## AMSI.dll
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 2888,
  "total_addresses_unique": 2880,
  "total_functions": 44,
  "file_size_kb": 69.5
}
```

## Kernel32.dll
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 28698591,
  "total_addresses_unique": 24926,
  "total_functions": 176062,
  "file_size_kb": 746.5
}
```

## mozavutil.dll (random firefox DLL)
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 3769,
  "total_addresses_unique": 2912,
  "total_functions": 74,
  "file_size_kb": 191.7
}
```

## msimg32.dll (in sys32)
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 418,
  "total_addresses_unique": 418,
  "total_functions": 12,
  "file_size_kb": 8
}
```

## msys-sqlite3eval-0.dll (git)
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 1223,
  "total_addresses_unique": 1223,
  "total_functions": 9,
  "file_size_kb": 10
}
```

## Meterpreter.dll - Basic
Created with `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=127.0.0.1 lport=1111 -a x86 -f dll -o meterp.dll`
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 319,
  "total_addresses_unique": 319,
  "total_functions": 12,
  "file_size_kb": 8
}
```

## Meterpreter.dll - Shikata Ga Nai
Created with: `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=127.0.0.1 lport=1111 -a x86 -f dll -o meterp_enc.dll -e x86/shikata_ga_nai`
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 319,
  "total_addresses_unique": 319,
  "total_functions": 12,
  "file_size_kb": 8
}
```

## Malware Sample
From this blog: [https://inquest.net/blog/2019/01/29/Carving-Sneaky-XLM-Files](https://inquest.net/blog/2019/01/29/Carving-Sneaky-XLM-Files)
```json
{
  "total_addresses": 3426,
  "total_addresses_unique": 3426,
  "total_functions": 2,
  "file_size_kb": 6
}
```

So far, the results are far from inconclusive: Windows DLLs might call 10s-100s of functions, but so did metepreter. Metepreter's `total_addresses` is very different from Windows DLLs, but not the Mozilla DLL.

# Conclusion
It's back to the drawing board with the hypothis - there might be better qeustions to ask, or to focus on specific types of entrypoints, such as `ServiceMain` and services.
But now I have a platform (Ghidra and its Scripting API) to ask more questions.
