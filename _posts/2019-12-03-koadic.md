# Overview
[Koadic](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic) is an open source post exploitation tool for red teamers, written in VBScript/JScript
with a Python3 HTTPS-based C2 backend.

The implant side is fairly straightforward - Its persitance and elevation functionality uses hardcoded well-known and signatured
methods, and almost all of its stagers get blocked by Windows Defender on Win 10. Nonetheless it has a decent following on Github,
and has even been used by an [APT](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/) crew in the past.

I was interested in doing a review of it, and noticed when hitting scanning a running C2 server,
it would always return the following empty HTTP response:

```html
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
Server: Apache
Date: Fri, 02 Aug 2019 03:43:28 GMT
```

The `Date` header would change be the correct time, but besides that, a few things stand out when comparing this response
to one from a Typical real-world Apache Webserver:
- Apache servers typically return version information in the `Server` header (although this can be configured)
- Apache servers return the `Date` header **above** the `Server` header.
- Apache servers typically will also send more headers, such as `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, or `Content-Type`

# Searching Shodan for Koadic
Unfortunetly the Shodan API doesn't allow us to specify header ordering, however we can still search for responses that contain:
 - `HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found`
 - `Server: Apache`
 - `Date` (As that actual date will change, but this will cover the presence of the header)
 - *not* any other header

The Final Shodan query looks like this:
```
"HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found" "Server: Apache"   -"Content-Type" -"Content-Length" -"Connection" -"Expires" -"Access-Control" -"Set-Cookie" -"Content-Encoding" -"Charset" -"Transfer-Encoding"
```

Searching Shodan (as of January 2020) has surprising results:

Out of all of Shodan, only 28 results! And looking at a sampling of the results, a lot certainly look suspicious enough to be possible C2 servers:
 - One had a sibling subdomain that was previouslly hostinng a [a malicious hta document](https://twitter.com/dissectmalware/status/1144504828896468992)
   - Investigating, I found out this was a koaded 1st stage
 - One had mutliple ports open, pretending to be both `Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)` and `Microsoft-IIS/7.5`
 - One literally had `koadic.fr` in its TLS cert name

These results, combined with the low number of hits, gives me confidence this signature is correct.

# Conclusion
As Koadic was created for legitimate red-teamers, it is unlikely any of these are actualy "the bad guys".

But understanding what fingerprint a tool creates is usefull to help the blue team detect actualy bad uses of Koadic, as well as help
the red teamers understand what footprint they may create.
